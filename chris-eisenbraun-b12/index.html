		<blockquote>Thank you for your very professional and prompt response. I went to look for answers to my own questions and quickly realized that the information I was requesting was very easy to find. As were the videos and the instructions. In fact everything has been perfect so far. This is by far the most well supported theme I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Lots of wonderful options. I wished I had found you before I spent money on a competitors theme. Thanks again for the great support and for a great product.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>If I could give 100 stars for support and attention to detail I definitely would. I’ve purchased a good number of WordPress themes from various developers that look good on Themeforest but after you buy them you find numerous problems, bugs, crazy admin and very very poor support. I purchased the Avada theme and there were a couple of problems too, but the guys from ThemeFusion were remarkable – I really mean this. The speed of support and attention to detail is quite phenomenal. You will be extremely pleased.</blockquote>
