# UXE - Advanced CSS Layout

### Assignment

Over the past two days we discussed module UI development, OOCSS and SMACSS. To illustrate learning these concepts, the first part of this assignment is to set up and use a module document technique for developing your CSS. 

The second part of this assignment is to begin applying the presentation to the HTML document created last week using advanced CSS, positioning and layout techniques learned in today's lessons. The expectations IS NOT to design the whole page. 

#### Concepts to illustrate:

1. Use if a Grid system
2. Understanding of the box model and appropriate uses
3. Use of efficient selectors
4. Example cases of attribute selectors
5. Without relying on the grid solution, use examples of floats with a clearfix
6. Advanced positioning (relative vs absolute)
7. Examples of inline-block
8. Examples of flexbox
9. Examples of calc()

*To turn in this assignment, each person in the pair, in canvas, submit the URL to the    repo.*
